  <h2> About me</h2>
  <p> I enjoy many different forms of art including visual art, music and performing art to name a few. I make visual art in my free time. Below is a photo of me next to my art at an art auction!</p>
  <p> I also love the beach, and that Lake Michigan is a walk away from IIT. Below is a picture of the sunrise on Lake Michigan</p>
